libLAS Installation
***************************************************************


Unix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

libLAS uses a typical GNU autoconf/automake framework for 
building and installation on unix-like platforms.  

The quick and dirty installation that would install things 
by default in /usr/local might look like:

::

    ./configure
    make
    make install

Alternatively, the only additional extensions that configure 
supports are to enable debugging information:

::

    ./configure --enable-debug --prefix=/home/hobu/liblas
    
Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Copy the windows package zip file into a directory of your 
choosing and unzip.  You should be able to run the utility 
applications or link your applications to the .lib file 
provided.
