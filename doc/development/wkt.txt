Summary
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This document proposes how to handle describing spatial reference systems 
in `ASPRS LAS`_ 1.4. LAS 1.4 prescribes that software developers add and 
prefer to use OGC WKT coordinate system description in the form of VLR 
records in LAS files.  Softwares can choose to continue to write GeoTIFF keys 
to support older applications, but they should prefer the OGC WKT if it is 
found in the file.

Rationale
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LAS 1.3 and below have used `GeoTIFF`_ keys as described by the `GeoTIFF
specification`_, but use of the GeoTIFF keys within LAS has a number of
deficiencies:

* GeoTIFF is typically tied to the `EPSG database`_ and does not provide
  simple mechanisms for extended definitions.
* Only a few softwares provide support for working with GeoTIFF keys directly.
* The GeoTIFF specification has no organization backing its continued
  development.
* GeoTIFF does not offer a mechanism to represent transformations between
  datums, while OGC WKT offers the TOWGS84[] mechanism

OGC WKT
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `OGC Simple Feature Access`_ specification provides the "Well-known Text
Representation of Spatial Reference Systems" (WKT) language in section nine.
WKT is much more expressive than GeoTIFF keys, has an organization providing
institutional heft and progress behind it, and a number of open source and
commercial softwares are available to support parsing and interpreting WKT
output.

There are a few dialects of WKT of which to be aware. The most common dialect
is the "ESRI WKT" dialect, which does not include TOWGS84 and authority nodes,
but there are others including "GDAL", "CSMap", "Oracle 9", "Oracle 10", and
"GeoTools." It should be assumed that all WKT provided in LAS files should be
of a dialect that is not the "ESRI WKT" dialect, which lacks some important
features -- notably TOWGS84 and AUTHORITY nodes. If you have questions about
how to produce WKT, please participate on the `MetaCRS`_ mailing list.
Examples of WKT may also be found on the http://spatialreference.org website.

Transition
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Older softwares may want to continue to use GeoTIFF keys, and it is not
desirable to have an abrupt discontinuity in the description of coordinate
systems for LAS data. Additionally, while many softwares may not need the
features of OGC WKT, its usage represents the strongest case for
interoperability with other software -- especially software in the GIS and CAD
domains that take advantage of the OGC WKT specification.

Softwares that currently write GeoTIFF VLR records into LAS files can continue
to do so in LAS 1.4. It is acceptable to write *only* GeoTIFF VLR records into
an LAS file, while softwares that choose to write OGC WKT VLRs should also
write GeoTIFF VLRs to promote backward compatibility If a file is found to
have both OGC WKT and GeoTIFF VLRs, the OGC WKT description, which is more
expressive, should be preferred if possible.

Implementation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OGC WKT strings shall be provided in a VLR with the following attributes:

* User ID: LASF_Projection
* Record ID: 2112

The following conditions should also apply:

* Because VLRs can only be 65536 size, an OGC WKT string in a VLR data block 
  is functionally limited to 64K in size.
* The OGC WKT VLR data shall be a null-terminated string.
* The OGC WKT VLR data shall be considered UTF-8.
* The OGC WKT VLR data shall be considered ``C`` locale-based, and no 
  localization of the numeric strings within the WKT should be performed.
