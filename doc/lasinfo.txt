  LASinfo : simply prints the header contents and a short
            summary of the points. when there are differences
            between header info and point content they are
            reported as a warning.

            can also be used to modify entries in the header
            as described below

****************************************************************

example usage:

>> lasinfo lidar.las

reports header and point information.

>> lasinfo -i lidar.las -variable

also reports the contents of any variable headers there might be.

>> lasinfo -i lidar.las -nocheck

omits reading over all the points. only reports header information.

>> lasinfo -i lidar.las -repair

if there are missing or wrong entries in the header they are corrected

>> lasinfo -i lidar.las -repair_boundingbox

reads all points, computes their bounding box, and updates it in the header

>> lasinfo -i lidar.las -file_creation 8 2007

sets the file creation day/year in the header to 8/2007

>> lasinfo -i lidar.las -system_identifier "hello world!"

copies the first 31 characters of the string into the system_identifier field of the header 

>> lasinfo -i lidar.las -generating_software "this is a test (-:"

copies the first 31 characters of the string into the generating_software field of the header
