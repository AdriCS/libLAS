Description
-----------

:ref:`las2las2 <las2las2>` reads and writes LiDAR data in the ASPRS LAS 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2 formats while 
modifying its contents. :ref:`las2las2 <las2las2>` is designed for filtering and 
transformation operations of LAS files.  

While `lasinfo` can do a few simple operations like 
updating header information, more drastic changes, like removing points or 
altering values, will require :ref:`las2las2 <las2las2>`.  :ref:`las2las` is expected to be used for 
modifying single files at a time, and some :ref:`las2las` operations require multiple 
read passes through the points.   Some examples of operations `las2las` can be 
used for include:

* clipping of points to those that lie within a certain region specified 
  by a bounding box (--extent )
* eliminating points that are the second return (--drop-return 2), 
* eliminating points that have a scan angle 
  above some threshold (--drop-scan-angle "<5")
* eliminating points that have an intensity below some 
  threshold (--drop-intensity "<15")
* extracting only first (--first-only) or last (--last-only) returns
* changing the format from LAS 1.0 to 1.1 or vice versa
* eliminating points of a given classification (--eliminate class 2)

:ref:`las2las2 <las2las2>` started a port of Martin Isenburg's :ref:`las2las` utility from `LASTools`_ 
to the libLAS library.  It is much-improved from his version, however, and 
provides a number of additional capabilities.

* Text output describing the operation(s) is only provided when the --verbose (-v)
  switch is provided.  Errors are reported to stderr.

* Coordinate reprojection, including vertical datum transformation when compiled 
  with the latest `GDAL`_.  

* Coordinate system description and alteration.

* Variable Length Records (VLRs) are carried forward by default.

* VLR alteration, including adding your own VLRs with files and removal of VLRs

* File splitting based on a specified file size (--split-mb) or points (--split-pts)

* Ability to set coordinate offsets to minimum values of the existing coordinate space.

* Color filtering
  
Usage
-----

Clipping with a rectangle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

  $ las2las in.las --output out.las --extent 63025000 483450000 63050000 483475000

clips points of in.las with x<=63025000 and y<=483450000 or x>=63050000
and y>=483475000 and stores surviving points to out.las.

::

  $ las2las in.las --output out.las --extent 63025000 483450000 0 63050000 483475000 100

clips points of in.las with x <= 63025000 and y <= 483450000 and z <= 100 or x >= 63050000
and y >= 483475000 and z >= 0


Eliminating specified returns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::
  
  $ las2las --input in.las --output out.las --drop-returns 1

eliminates all points of in.las that are designated first returns by the 
value in their return_number field and stores surviving points to out.las.

::
  
  $ las2las --input in.las --output out.las --drop-returns 2 3 4 5

eliminates all returns in the specified list.

Limiting based on scan angle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

  $ las2las --input in.las --output out.las --keep-scan-angle "<=15"

keeps all points of in.las whose scan angle is <= 15.

Limiting based on intensity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

  $ las2las --input in.las --output out.las --drop-intensity "<=1000" 
  
eliminates all points of in.las whose intensity is below 1000 and stores 
surviving points to out.las.

Extract last returns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::
  
  $ las2las --input in.las --output out.las --last_return_only

extracts all last return points from in.las and stores them to out.las.

Throw out invalid data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

  $ las2las --input in.las --output out.las --valid-only

removes invalid (according to the ASPRS LAS file format specification) points.
This switch should only be required in a few special circumstances. Points
that might be invalid include those with larger-than-required scan angles.

Eliminate ground points
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

  $ las2las --input in.las --output out.las --drop-classes 2

removes points with that have a classification of 2. Points with a
classification of 2 are conventionally called ground points, but that
convention may not be followed for older LAS 1.0 files.

Eliminate ground and unclassified points
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

  $ las2las --input in.las --output out.las --drop-classes 1 2
  
removes points that have a classification of 1 or 2.
  


Convert to 1.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

  $ las2las --input in.las --output out.las --format 1.1
  
converts the in.las file to a 1.1-formatted file.  For the most part, this 
conversion is "in name only." 

Alter vertical datum information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

  $ las2las in.las --a_vertcs 5703 "North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88)" 5103 9001
  
sets the vertical datum information for the file to be NAVD88 with vertical 
units of meters. 

.. note::
    This may not be relevant depending upon the circumstances of the coordinate 
    system the file is already in.  This option only changes the *description* 
    of the points.  It does not reproject them in any way.  Use a combination 
    of --a_srs and --t_srs to do perform reprojection of the file

File splitting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

  $ las2las in.las --split-mb 10

splits the file into the required number of output-n.las files. Other filters
or operations may also be applied to the operation in combination with
splitting. Each outputted file will have its extents and point counts properly
set.

::

  $ las2las in.las --split-pts 100000

splits the file into the required number of output-n.las files with 100000
points each in them. Other filters or operations may also be applied to the
operation in combination with splitting. Each outputted file will have its
extents and point counts properly set.
  
.. note::
    --split-mb and --split-pts will not work exactly with --min-offset.  
    --min-offset will take the minimum offsets of *the entire file*, not 
    each individual file that is a result of the split.


VLR addition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

  $ las2las in.las --add-vlr CUSTOM_VLR 42 "A VLR description" "myfile.ext"

adds a new VLR with name CUSTOM_VLR and an ID of 42. "myfile.ext" can either 
be a location to a file to read to write into the VLR, or properly escaped 
text that will be inserted directly into the VLR.  

.. warning::
    VLRs have a size limitation of 65536 bytes.  Files that are read or 
    escaped arguments that are larger than 64k in size will cause an error 
    to be thrown.  Automatic truncation will not happen.


VLR removal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

  $ las2las in.las --delete-vlr CUSTOM_VLR 42

removes all VLRs from in.las when writing the new output.las file.
